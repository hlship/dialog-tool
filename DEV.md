# Developer Notes

## TODO / Ideas / Plans/ Bugs

- Visual feedback when the skein changes
- The graph view (currently it's just a serial view, one path through the graph)
- Collapsable text
- Buttons to jump to next/prev command
- Mark a node w/ a tag: solution (to be included in the packaged game)
- Animation when adding/removing nodes
- Search the Skein
- Jump to "nearest" unblessed node
- Show the path to the Skein file in the menu bar
- Visual feedback is a problem, because the round-trip is often just milliseconds.
- Add an indicator that there are invisible whitespace changes in a diff
- flowbright-svelete progress bar how to know when it is dismissed by user
- Recognize when the `dgdebug` command fails to launch entirely (currently, results in :unblessed as null)
- Jumping to a node w/ no children should scroll to the command prompt and focus on it
- Don't allow editting of the label for the root knot
- Maybe time to change "bless" to "approve"?
